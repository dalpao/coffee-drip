              <h2>Espresso</h2>
              <p>
                is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin in which a small
                amount of nearly boiling water is forced under 9–10 bars of
                pressure through finely-ground coffee beans.

              <h2>V60</h2>
              <p>
                The V60 has become increasingly popular in recent years. It
                delivers incredibly clear flavours and aromas, allowing coffee
                lovers to enjoy even the subtlest notes in their coffee. For
                this reason, the V60 is one of specialty coffee’s favourite
                brewing methods.

              <h2>Chemex</h2>
              <p>
                The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual pour-over style glass
                coffeemaker. It consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with
                a conical funnel-like neck and proprietary filters, made of
                bonded paper. The thick paper of the Chemex filters removes most
                of the coffee oils and makes coffee that is much "cleaner" than
                coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems.

              <h2>Aeropress</h2>
              <p>
                The AeroPress consists of a cylindrical chamber and a plunger
                with an airtight silicone seal. Ground coffee beans and water
                are steeped inside, then forced through a filter by pressing the
                plunger through the chamber. It is capable of brewing highly
                concentrated coffee, which the manufacturer describes as
                "espresso style", but can also be used to brew filter strength
                coffee, or cold brew coffee.
